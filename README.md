# Flappy Birds

# Inspiration
  We were inspired by the retro track of the hackathon and decided to develop a classic game.

# What it does
  The flappy bird jumps with the aim of not touching the group and the pipes. We hold a score based on the number of pipes the bird has passed successfully

# How we built it
  We used HTML and CSS to create the animation and basic outline and Javascript to develop the gameplay.

# Challenges we ran into
  We had a hard time measuring the pixels to make the program perfect.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
  Animations, and Score Counter

# What we learned
  We were all beginners, so we've learned about animations.

# What's next for Flappy Bird
  Create a "Game Over" page and store scores on a database to include high scores.
